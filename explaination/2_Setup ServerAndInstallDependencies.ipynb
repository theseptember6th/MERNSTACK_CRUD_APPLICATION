    "To begin, you'll want to open your code editor, such as Visual Studio Code. If you prefer a different editor, feel free to use that instead. Inside your chosen editor, navigate to your desktop and create a new folder. Give this folder a name that makes sense for your project, perhaps \"mernstack\" or something similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have this main project folder, open it in your code editor. Within this folder, you will create two new folders. The first one will be named \"server,\" and this will house all the code related to your Express.js backend. The second folder will be named \"client,\" and this is where your React application will reside.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, let's focus on the backend. Navigate into the \"server\" folder using your terminal. Once inside, you'll initialize this folder as an npm package. You can do this by running the command `npm init`. This command will walk you through a series of prompts to set up your `package.json` file. You can either accept the default values by pressing Enter repeatedly, or you can provide specific details such as the project description and author. For the entry point, it's common to use `index.js`, which we will create shortly.\n",
    "\n",
    "After initializing npm, create a new file within the \"server\" folder and name it `index.js`. This file will be the main entry point for your server-side application, and it's where you'll write your Express.js code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start writing any code, we need to install the necessary packages that our server will rely on. We'll be using npm to install these.We will search `npm home`and search for following packages there. The packages we need are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `dotenv`: This package allows you to load environment variables from a `.env` file. This is useful for keeping sensitive information, like database connection strings, separate from your main code.\n",
    "* `body-parser`: This is middleware for Express.js that helps in processing the bodies of incoming requests. It allows you to easily access data sent in various formats, such as JSON.\n",
    "* `express`: This is the core web application framework for Node.js that we'll be using to build our server and define our API endpoints.\n",
    "* `mongoose`: This package provides an elegant way to interact with MongoDB databases from Node.js. It handles things like data modeling, validation, and querying.\n",
    "* `nodemon`: This is a helpful tool for development. When you make changes to your server-side code, nodemon will automatically detect those changes and restart your server, saving you the manual step of restarting it every time. We'll install this as a development dependency since it's primarily used during development and not needed in a production environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install these packages, you'll use the `npm install` command in your terminal, while still inside the \"server\" directory. You'll install `dotenv`, `body-parser`, `express`, and `mongoose` as regular dependencies. For `nodemon`, you'll install it as a dev dependency using the `--save-dev` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once these installations are complete, you'll find them listed in the `package.json` file under either \"dependencies\" or \"devDependencies\" (in the case of nodemon).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you have your server project set up with the essential dependencies installed. "

    "- We use **`npm install <package>`** for regular (production) dependencies.\n",
    "- We use **`npm install <package> --save-dev`** for development-only dependencies (like nodemon).\n",
