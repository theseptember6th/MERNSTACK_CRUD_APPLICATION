    "\n",
    "Within the `server` directory, create the following three key folders:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **`models` Folder**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: To define the structure/schema of MongoDB collections using Mongoose.\n",
    "- **Creates**: `userModel.js`\n",
    "- **Role**: Manages how data is stored, validated, and interacts with MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Typical Contents of `userModel.js`:**\n",
    "```js\n",
    "import mongoose from 'mongoose';\n",
    "\n",
    "const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({\n",
    "  name: {\n",

    "const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);\n",
    "\n",
    "export default User;\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. **`controllers/` Folder**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: To handle all business logic and request/response processing.\n",
    "- **Creates**: `userController.js`\n",
    "- **Role**: Processes client requests, performs operations (like DB queries), and returns responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Typical Contents of `userController.js`:**\n",
    "```js\n",
    "import User from '../models/userModel.js';\n",

    "  }\n",
    "};\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3. **`routes/` Folder**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: To define URL endpoints and map them to controller functions.\n",
    "- **Creates**: `userRoutes.js`\n",
    "- **Role**: Handles routing logic — determines what happens for each HTTP method and endpoint.\n",

    "## 🧠 Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keep your project modular: Avoid writing everything in one file (e.g., `index.js`).\n",
    "- Use **camelCase** for filenames like `userModel.js`, `userController.js`, and `userRoutes.js`.\n",
    "- Use **ES Modules (ESM)** syntax: `import` and `export` instead of `require` and `module.exports`.\n",
    "- Always separate concerns:\n",
    "  - Model = database logic\n",
    "  - Controller = application logic\n",
    "  - Routes = HTTP endpoint logic\n",

    "## ✅ Benefits of This Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Easier to expand as your app grows.\n",
    "- **Maintainability**: Bugs are easier to locate and fix.\n",
    "- **Reusability**: Functions and modules can be reused across routes and controllers.\n",
    "- **Readability**: Codebase is easier to understand for new developers.\n",
