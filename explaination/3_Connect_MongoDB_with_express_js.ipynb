    "* **Import Dependencies**: Begin by importing the necessary modules: `express` for creating the server, `mongoose` for MongoDB interaction, `body-parser` for handling request bodies, and any module for loading environment variables.\n",
    "* **Create .env File**: Create a `.env` file in your server directory. This file will store configuration settings, such as the port number your application will run on (e.g., 8000) and the connection string for your MongoDB database.\n",
    "* **Get MongoDB URL**: To get the MongoDB connection string, use MongoDB Compass. After creating a database (e.g., \"mon\") and a collection (e.g., \"users\") in Compass, you can copy the connection string.\n",
    "* **Paste Connection String**: Paste the copied connection string into your `.env` file. Ensure that you include the name of your database in the connection string.\n",
    "* **Create Express App Instance**: Create an instance of the Express application. This instance will be used to define routes and handle requests.\n",
    "* **Apply JSON Parsing Middleware**: Use the `body-parser.json()` middleware. This middleware parses incoming requests with JSON payloads and makes the data available in the `req.body` property.\n",
    "* **Load Environment Variables**: Load the environment variables from the `.env` file using the `dotenv.config()` function. This makes the variables accessible in your application.\n",
    "* **Retrieve Port and MongoDB URL**: Retrieve the port number and MongoDB URL from the environment variables using `process.env`.\n",
    "* **Connect to MongoDB**: Use `mongoose.connect()` to establish a connection to your MongoDB database. Pass the MongoDB URL as an argument.\n",
    "* **Handle Connection Success**: If the connection to the database is successful, log a message to the console, such as \"DB connected successfully.\"\n",
    "* **Start the Server**: Start the Express server and make it listen on the specified port. Log a message to the console indicating that the server is running and on which port.\n",
    "* **Handle Connection Errors**: Implement error handling to catch any errors that may occur during the database connection process. Log any errors to the console for debugging.\n",

    " Connecting MongoDB with Express.js\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧩 Goal:\n",
    "To set up a connection between the Express backend server and a MongoDB database.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. **Import Required Dependencies**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `index.js` file (located inside the `server` folder), import the core dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "import express from 'express';\n",
    "import mongoose from 'mongoose';\n",
    "import bodyParser from 'body-parser';\n",
    "import dotenv from 'dotenv';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. **Create `.env` File for Configuration**\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a file named `.env` inside the `server` folder. This file is used to store environment variables such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```env\n",
    "PORT=8000\n",
    "URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/mon\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Replace the `URL` value with your actual MongoDB connection string. You can obtain this from MongoDB Compass or MongoDB Atlas.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. **Setup MongoDB Database (Locally using MongoDB Compass)**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open MongoDB Compass.\n",
    "2. Click “Connect”.\n",
    "3. Once connected, click **+** to create a new database.\n",
    "4. Give it a **database name**, e.g., `mern`.\n",
    "5. Give a **collection name**, e.g., `users`.\n",
    "6. Click “Create Database”.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. **Initialize Express App**\n",
    "\n",
    "Create the Express application and use necessary middleware:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "const app = express();\n",
    "app.use(bodyParser.json());\n",
    "dotenv.config();  // Load environment variables from .env file\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. **Read Configuration from `.env`**\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "const PORT = process.env.PORT || 7000;\n",
    "const URL = process.env.URL;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> This ensures if `.env` is not found, the app will still default to port 7000.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. **Connect to MongoDB using Mongoose**\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "mongoose.connect(URL)\n",
    "  .then(() => {\n",
    "    console.log(\"DB connected successfully\");\n",
    "    app.listen(PORT, () => {\n",
    "      console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);\n",
    "    });\n",
    "  })\n",
    "  .catch((error) => {\n",
    "    console.log(\"Connection error:\", error);\n",
    "  });\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ What this does:\n",
    "- `mongoose.connect(URL)` tries to connect to MongoDB.\n",
    "- On success (`.then`), it starts the server.\n",
    "- On failure (`.catch`), it logs the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. **Development Notes**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using `nodemon` is recommended during development for automatic server restarts on file changes.\n",
    "- Use extensions like **Prettier** for clean and consistent formatting.\n",
    "- Always keep sensitive information like database URLs inside `.env` files (never hard-coded).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧪 Testing the Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing the setup:\n",
    "1. Run the server using:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   npm start\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If using `nodemon`, you can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   npx nodemon index.js\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. You should see:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   DB connected successfully\n",
    "   Server is running on port 8000\n",
    "   ```\n",
